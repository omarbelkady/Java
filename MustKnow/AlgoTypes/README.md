## Types of Algorithms

- Backtracking Algorithm
    - recursive problem solving approach
    - I come up with N number of solution
    - If the first solution does not solve my problem I go back
    - I try the second solution and so forth
    - I remove the first solution
    - Playing soduku you find 4 is in the row, column and box therefore you backtrack and check 5
    - Trying to find your way out in a maze

- Brute Force Algorithm
    - Check every possible solution for the problem to be solved

- Divide And Conquer Algorithm
    - Divide the problem into sub-problems and solve each sub-problem independently
    - i.e. Binary Search

- Dynamic Programming Algorithm
    - function X generates the output Y
    - I store the result of Y and use it in function D

- Greedy Algorithm
    - Always chooses the best solution
    - Solution is built piece by piece
    - The subsequent piece chosen by the algorithm is usually the most obvious
    - Examples in Various DS:

- Recursive Algorithm
    - an algorithm which calls itself
    - i.e. factorial
